E Safety

in our lesson last week we had the first lesson in E safety. our main focus was on how grooming was effective and what it was. we began on the subject (not so pleasant) of rape and paedophiles. we were told that most paedophiles were men, and most victims were non puberic boys. we talked on how the legal age to have sex was 16 and anyone under is being a lawbreaker. 

now to the subject of grooming. grooming is the most effective way to get someone to do something. for example: paedophiles can groom someone into going somewhere and being raped, or similar. it could also be used to make someone think something. like that someone is really bad but they aren't. 

then we moved on to pornography, and how it is illegal to make child pornography but you are allowed to make as much adult porn as you like. sexting however, is a very different matter. you are not supposed to do it. so as we neared the end of the lesson, we all learnt that E~safety is very important.
